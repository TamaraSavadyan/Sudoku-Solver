# Sudoku-Solver

My Sudoku Solver. I like solving sudoku in my free time, so I decided to make this program.
This project helped me to learn Backtrack algorithm and how to use basic Python GUI module Tkinter.

## Launching
If you want to check my project you can do the following:
1) Download repository and open Sudoku.exe file.
2) Check out my .py files. Sudoku_BackTrack.py is algorithm's file, Sudoku_GUI.py contains GUI logic.

## Tutorial

1) You can either set default numbers or enter your own. At the start of program you will see a window in which you can choose the option.
2) If you choose entering numbers on your own, press "Done" button after you're done.
3) To solve sudoku press "Solve!" button. This will fill all empty cells with missing numbers.
4) To set new values, press "Clear" button to clear all fields. Then press "Set" button and enter new numbers.
5) You can return to original numbers (ones you entered) by pressing "Default" button.
